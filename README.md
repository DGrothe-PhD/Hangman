# C++ Hangman ReadMe #
**Name:** Hangman  
**Version:** 0.4.1.4  
**Contributors:** Xethron

Simple Hangman game used for educational purposes.

## Description ##
The project started as a goal to learn C++. As I learned more, I improved the application, and now its just something to fool around with.
After finding GitHub, this was the only *"useful"* project to upload as to test out GitHub.

I plan to convert this to pure C and clean up the code. Then I'll improve it where I can.
